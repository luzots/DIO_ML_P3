# DIO_ML_P3
Bootcamp DIO Machine Learning - Project 3 Confusion Matrix / Metrics Calculation

* This project is only for educational purposes.
* This project was created from scratch with AI support.
* The ROC graphs are showing I think a " perfect model" and I don't know if this is a technical issue or a graph visualization problem ( scale, decimal numbers, etc.)
  
The project used the MNIST dataset.
Through the confusion matrix , all the metrics are calculated.
The ROC graphs are 2 : one of them evaluating the model including all classes  , and the other one separeting the evaluation by classes.
